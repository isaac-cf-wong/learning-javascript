This repository records my journey of learning JavaScript. It contains notes, examples, and a Quarto book that documents concepts, techniques, and discoveries as I explore the language.

> **Disclaimer:**
> This book is a living document and is never complete. Content will be added incrementally as I learn new things. Please check back for updates!
